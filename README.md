Problem Statement
	We have the dataset(housing data multiple dimensions where we have to predict the house.
Approach
	1.Load the data
	2.Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
	3.Pre-processing data (Filling missing values etc)
	4.Modelling
	5.Prediction

I used varies null value handling methods and encoding techniques
to make ready the data for machine learning model.

I used five algorithm to create a model

             1.Linear regression
             2.decision tree
             3.random forest
             4.adaboost
             5.gradientboost

among all the model random forest accurecy is higher
